## 1. Controls for Extending Credit in a Furniture Store
To ensure that only authorized employees can extend credit and manage customer accounts, the store owner should implement the following controls:

**a. Segregation of Duties:**
- Separate responsibilities among employees for extending credit, recording payments, and making adjustments. For example, one employee could handle credit approvals while another manages payment processing.

**b. Authorization Controls:**
- Establish a formal approval process for extending credit. This could involve requiring a manager's approval for any credit sales above a certain limit.
- Use a system where only designated employees have access to credit extension functionalities in the software.

**c. Access Controls:**
- Implement user access levels in the accounting or sales software to restrict who can modify customer balances or extend credit.
- Regularly review and update access permissions to ensure they align with employee roles.

**d. Audit Trails:**
- Maintain logs of all transactions related to credit extensions and adjustments. This should include timestamps, user IDs, and details of the changes made.
- Conduct periodic audits to review these logs for unauthorized changes.

**e. Training and Policies:**
- Provide training for employees on the importance of following credit policies and the consequences of unauthorized actions.
- Develop clear policies regarding credit sales to friends and relatives, ensuring they are documented and followed.


## 2. Controls for Electronic Payments to Suppliers
To ensure that payments are legitimate and authorized, the following controls should be implemented:

**a. Three-Way Matching:**
- Implement a three-way matching process where the invoice, purchase order, and receiving report must all match before a payment is processed. This ensures that payment is only made for goods or services that were actually received.

**b. Supplier Validation:**
- Maintain a master list of approved suppliers. Any new supplier must go through a verification process before being added to the system.
- Require documentation (e.g., W-9 forms) to validate the legitimacy of suppliers.

**c. Authorization Controls:**
- Set up a system where payments require multiple levels of approval, especially for larger amounts. For example, a supervisor or manager should approve payments above a certain threshold.
- Use electronic signatures or approval workflows in the accounting software to ensure that payments are authorized.

**d. Payment Limits:**
- Establish payment limits for different employees based on their roles. For instance, junior staff may only be able to approve payments up to a certain amount.

**e. Regular Reconciliation:**
- Conduct regular reconciliations of accounts payable to ensure that all payments made correspond to legitimate invoices and received goods.
- Review supplier statements periodically to identify any discrepancies.

**f. Fraud Detection Mechanisms:**
- Implement fraud detection tools within the accounting software that flag unusual payment patterns or payments to new suppliers without proper documentation.


By implementing these controls, the furniture store and the bookkeeping system can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized credit extensions and fraudulent payments.
